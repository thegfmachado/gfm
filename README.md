# My Website

The goal of this project is to centralize all my professional experiences and achievements in an organized, practical, and visually appealing way. The portfolio was developed to showcase my skills, projects, and career path, as well as to serve as a point of contact for future opportunities for collaboration and growth.

## Technologies

This project was developed with Next.js and uses Shadcn/UI as the component library, along with Tailwind CSS for styling. PostgreSQL was used to store user feedback and blog articles.
